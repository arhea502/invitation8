                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What happens:</strong> I thought it'd be fun to gather everyone ngl. Plus. I'd like to apologise sometime. It doesnt have to be right away. Atm it could just be a game night. Then we could talk whenever you feel ready. This isn't some desperate attempt. I know I was partly wrong. I just want to know we're good. Because you're my friend and you matter to me.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice Chat:</strong> You and Leland can use discord. Me and Irmelin might use in game call. ONLY IF SHES IN, if not then I'd like to just play the game and not call.  Mite would be too busy with his music.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game Modes:</strong> Expect to play Quick Play, Competitive, and maybe even some Custom Modes!</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Weâ€™ll be playing for a few hours, but join whenever you can!</li>
                    <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Just have Overwatch installed and ready to play!</li>
